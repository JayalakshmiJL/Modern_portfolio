              This project is an enhancement of the existing HDB site with a new module under the name Lens*cape for the users to share their memories around their neighborhood by participating in the Landscape competition by uploading their photos, videos, blogs etc.,
              <br/>
              Goal of this project was to design, develop, code and test the Lens*cape module and develop a sub-module for the e-mail notification for the participants informing the number of votes they have received for their posts.  New module had to be integrated with the existing modules thereby have to work in tandem. In that process, the existing modules were to be modified to some extent and vulnerability issues have arisen and got fixed. The whole project along with the enhancement was to be deployed at the HDB office server.
